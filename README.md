# Logistic Regression from Scratch 🧠

This project demonstrates how to implement **Logistic Regression** using only `NumPy` — no machine learning libraries like `scikit-learn`. It walks through the fundamentals of binary classification, optimization with gradient descent, and model evaluation.

## 📊 Dataset

- **breast-cancer.csv**: Public dataset for predicting breast cancer diagnosis.
- Features include medical measurements like cell size, uniformity, etc.
- Target variable: `0` (benign) or `1` (malignant)

## 🚀 Features

- Manual implementation of logistic regression
- Sigmoid activation
- Binary cross-entropy loss
- Gradient descent optimization
- Accuracy evaluation on test data
- Visualization of decision boundary (if applicable)

## 🧪 How to Run

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/logistic-regression-from-scratch.git
   cd logistic-regression-from-scratch
   ```

2. Open the Jupyter notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook notebooks/logistic_regression_from_scratch.ipynb
   ```

3. Run the notebook cells to:
   - Load the dataset
   - Normalize data
   - Train the model
   - Evaluate accuracy
